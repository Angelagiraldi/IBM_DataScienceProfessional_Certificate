## Description

This repository contains a collection of Jupiter notebooks and code exercises I worked on during the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
Each folder corresponds to a different course within the program and covers various topics and concepts related to data science and its applications.

## Course Content

The IBM Data Science Professional Certificate is a comprehensive program consisting of several courses, including:

### Course 1: What is Data Science?

-   ##### Description:  
Data Science has gained the label of being the sexiest profession of the 21st century due to its ability to uncover insights and trends in data, enabling data-driven conclusions and predictions. This introductory course provides a comprehensive understanding of Data Science, including concepts like Machine Learning and Neural Networks, and showcases real-world data science applications in business.
